            People come to React from different backgrounds and with different
            learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a
            practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.

            Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve.
            With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.

            The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in
            the JavaScript language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s
            harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recommend going through this JavaScript overview to check your
            knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but
            you will feel more confident learning React.

            When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags
            might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!
          </p>
          <p>
            As your application grows, you might want to consider a more
            integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we
            recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little
            to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich
            React ecosystem. Learn how.

            If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our practical tutorial.
            In this tutorial, we build a tic-tac-toe game in React. You might be
            tempted to skip it because you’re not into building games — but give
            it a chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to
            building any React apps, and mastering it will give you a much
            deeper understanding.

            The React blog is the official source for the updates from the React
            team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation
            notices, will be posted there first.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also follow the @reactjs account on Twitter, but you won’t
            miss anything essential if you only read the blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find
            a detailed changelog for every release in the CHANGELOG.md file in
            the React repository, as well as on the Releases page.
